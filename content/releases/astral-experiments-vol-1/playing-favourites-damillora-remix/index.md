## THE CAT MUST STAY ON THE MASTER BUS

My first ever remix and DTM attempt! Playing Favourites is one of my favorite tunes of recent (stay tuned for the Music Highlights post on that one!), and when I wanted to try my hand at DTM, I decided to try my hand on remixing this song.

This became a memorable production because of a funny incident: I added a visualization plugin in the form of the OIIAI cat on top of the master bus, thinking it would be funny, but removing it causes the DAW to crash! Yes, this song is mixed with a cat as part of the master bus...

As a sidenote, working on this remix made me realize, after all, Kaminari Clara is my favorite singing voice.
