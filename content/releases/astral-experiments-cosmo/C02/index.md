PURCHASE: Musica Caesarea

## DESPITE EVERYTHING THAT HAS HAPPENED

STACKNATION is expanding into non-Denonbu content, and I somehow get to be a part of it! Musica Caesarea is a compilation of Jersey Club music organized by STACKNATION. However, I'm wanted to not merely make Jersey Club, so I looked into other sources of inspirations... and then Contingency Contract Battleplan Arclight dropped. Feeling very inspired from that, I proceeded to attempt making Jersey Club music... with Synthwave sounds. Anachronism for the win?

On top of that, I recently got myself [The Nakuru voice database for Syntesizer V 2 AI](https://hifumi-pro.jp/synthesizerV/product/), and I have been thinking to use it somewhere that is not a cover, and this is where I'm first able to use it on an actual project.

As for why the lyrics turned out that way... let's just say my country has quite the uncertain future. I kinda let that flow into writing the lyrics, ehe.
